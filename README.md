# Probing-Quantum-Capacitance-Of-2D-materials-by-Novel-Technique
2D Materials can potentially help us realize the fascinating phenomenon such as Superconductivity at Room Temperature and Room Pressure, Quantum Computing of more than 70 Logical Qubits, Negative Quantum Capacitance, Quantum Memory Devices and many other applications based on the outstanding world of phenomenons such as Magnetism (orbital and Spin),Spin Orbit Coupling and Quantum Hall Effect, Quantum Anamolous Hall Effect, Quantum Spin Hall Effect, Co-related, Mott Insulators, Topological Insulators, Fractional Chern Insulators, Charge Density Wave Fluctuations, Nemacity , Pomeranchuk Effect etc. they show electrically! But to realize these epitomes practically we will have to probe these 2D materials and extract out the physical quantities that make us understand how these 2D materials behave electrically. 
We have successfully discussed the Probing of the 2D materials using various microscopy techniques and extracted out some dope quantities like Fermi Velocity , Fermi Energy , Phonon Velocity , Twist Angle , Thickness , Defect Characterization , etc. from Raman Spectroscopy and thickness of graphene and hBN from its optical contrast in Microscopy technique for our transfered hetero-structure . 
Moving on we have successfully extracted out Quantum Capacitance for our Dielectric-2D material-Dielectric hetero-structure on Si − SiO2 substrate by novel way and for graphene as 2D material’s in plane resistivity measurement and from extracted quantum capacitance calculated close to 15 physical quantities and all of them successfully match the already available data for graphene both extracted theoretically from energy eigen values and experimentally via various in plane measurement technique suggesting that this novel technique of extracting quantum capacitance is 100 percent accurate and a majority improvement over the already available complex techniques of ,
Constructing dielectric-2D material (whose quantum capacitance we want to measure)-dielectric-2D material (probes the top 2D material via its charge neutrality point)- dielectric using transfer technique and then carrying out in plane resistivity measurement of two Hall bar 2D material layers and ,
Making hardware changes in the capacitance measurement circuit using HEMT’s to reduce its parasitic capacitance.
This novel technique of extracting quantum capacitance can be applied for any 2D material and also the expressions discussed are general and not in any way specific to graphene and hence one can extract and completely characterize the electron transport of any 2D material using this technique and bring us one step closer to realizing these fascinating outlook.
